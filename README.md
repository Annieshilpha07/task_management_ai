📈 Usage Examples
1. Task Classification
Python

from task_ai import TaskClassifier

classifier = TaskClassifier()
result = classifier.classify("Review quarterly sales report and prepare presentation")
print(f"Category: {result['category']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2%}")
2. Priority Prediction
Python

from task_ai import PriorityPredictor

predictor = PriorityPredictor()
priority = predictor.predict(
    task="Fix critical bug in payment system",
    deadline="2024-01-15",
    assignee="John Doe"
)
print(f"Priority Score: {priority}/10")
3. Workload Balancing
Python

from task_ai import WorkloadBalancer

balancer = WorkloadBalancer()
distribution = balancer.distribute_tasks(tasks, team_members)
print("Optimal task distribution:", distribution)
